### Abstract
<p align="justify">
  In computer vision, human pose synthesis and transfer deal with probabilistic image generation of a person in a previously unseen pose from an already available observation of that person. Though researchers have recently proposed several methods to achieve this task, most of these techniques derive the target pose directly from the desired target image on a specific dataset, making the underlying process challenging to apply in real-world scenarios as the generation of the target image is the actual aim. In this paper, we first present the shortcomings of current pose transfer algorithms and then propose a novel text-based pose transfer technique to address those issues. We divide the problem into three independent stages: (a) text to pose representation, (b) pose refinement, and (c) pose rendering. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to develop a text-based pose transfer framework where we also introduce a new dataset DF-PASS, by adding descriptive pose annotations for the images of the DeepFashion dataset. The proposed method generates promising results with significant qualitative and quantitative scores in our experiments.

### Network Architecture
![network_architecture](https://github.com/prasunroy/tips/blob/main/docs/static/network_architecture.svg)
<p align="justify">
  The pipeline is divided into three stages. In stage 1, we estimate the target pose keypoints from the corresponding text description embedding. In stage 2, we regressively refine the initial estimation of the facial keypoints and obtain the refined target pose keypoints. Finally, in stage 3, we render the target image by conditioning the pose transfer on the source image.

### Generation Results
![results](https://github.com/prasunroy/tips/blob/main/docs/static/results.svg)
<p align="justify">
  Keypoints-guided methods tend to produce structurally inaccurate results when the physical appearance of the target pose reference significantly differs from the condition image. This observation is more frequent for the <i>out of distribution</i> target poses than the <i>within distribution</i> target poses. On the other hand, the existing text-guided method occasionally misinterprets the target pose due to a limited set of basic poses used for pose representation. The proposed text-guided technique successfully addresses these issues while retaining the ability to generate visually decent results close to the keypoints-guided baseline.
